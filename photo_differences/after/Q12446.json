All these areas are likely connected by the root system (rhizome) and are technically all part of the same stand. For reporting purposes, we have listed each area/property as an individual stand. Areas have been denoted as follows:- \n\nTarget property - laid mainly to artificial grass, small JK shoots along rear wall and rhizome evident when pulling back the ground cover. The concrete pathway runs the full length of the garden to the rear gate (or where the rear gate would be). \n \nNo9 - Green Netlon fencing along the boundary with the target property garden. JK in the fenced area looks treated. Also, cut stems are evident behind the shed, these are likely the stems that are in the alleyway behind the property (there are also a couple of stems loose in the garden behind this property on the other side of the alley - this garden is laid to hard standing and I think the debris has just blown/been thrown into the garden).\n\nAlleyway - behind no9 there are dead canes, likely from behind the shed. There is a small wooden partition panel in the alley that continues the boundary between 9 and 11. There is green JK foliage within the fly tip behind no11. I believe this is an actively growing plant and not one that has been pulled and discarded.\n\nThe garden behind no11 - is on the opposite side of the alleyway. Active JK growth is seen. A couple of large dogs in here so further growth may have been trampled / not evident. \n\nIn order to achieve complete control, all areas would need to be placed into a treatment program. We suspect the JK in no9 already is under a control program but would need confirmation that this includes the knotweed behind the shed. The rear alleyway would need clearing of waste and knotweed allowed to grow the following season. The target property garden could be isolated from the rest of the areas and treated as a standalone by the use of root barriers/membrane and treated or dugout. However, work would be difficult due to the inability to get an excavator into the garden.",
