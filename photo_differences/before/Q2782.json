    "19ac": "A single knotweed stand is situated to the rear left corner of the garden when standing with your back to the dwelling. The stand is evident in all three of the four JK areas as marked on the site plan. JK1 as on site plan - visible in the access pathway area 2m from the bottom end gate. A small patch (.4m by .4m) against the client property fence. Consists of a few small broken stems probably approx .5m high when they were viable. No visible knotweed in the garden area.\nJK2 as on site plan- knotweed has mostly been cleared mechanically at least. Difficult to infer any history of chemical treatment as only a few crowns are visible close to the fence. Fence is high and difficult to see over.\nJK3 as on site plan - this is the most obviously visibly infested area. Several square metres of knotweed are clearly visible. Stems are approx 2.5m high. The end of the access pathway is a wide gate. Access is possible the area through this gate but a key would be required (bolted).",
