# Important Notes

The [existing_site_visit_entries](existing_site_visit_entries.txt) file contains IDs of records that have already had their site visit entries processed. This means that the site visit entries have almost certainly been processed manually by someone. These records have not been updated and instead should be manually inspected to ensure that all data has been transferred across from the old "Japanese Knotweed Management Record" app to the new "SITE VISIT RECORDS" app

The following fields have not been transferred over to the new "SITE VISIT RECORDS" app:

- `audio_notes`: There is not a "audio" field for "Herbicide Application" entries so it felt wrong to add one in. Is this the correct course of action?

New fields have been added into the "SITE VISIT RECORDS" app. See the "Other Treatments Inc. Excavation" section.
