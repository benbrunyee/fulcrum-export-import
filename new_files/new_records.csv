The survey was conducted at the end of the timeframe normally associated with identification of perennial plants such as knotweed. Despite this, due to the type of evidence seen during the survey, these findings are reported with confidence in their accuracy.

The site, a parcel of land contained within the Broadmarsh Coastal Park, consists of a meadow set within a thin surrounding woodland strip. To the east of the site is a navigable waterway which empties into the harbour that is to the south of the site between Portsmouth and Hayling Island. More public space belonging to the park lies to the north and west. Harts Farm Way splits the park into two areas and bounds the site on its northern edge.

The site is frequented by the public for exercise and for dog walking; two main paths intersect the site while another path loops around the southern perimeter, next to the edge of the woodland. The site topography can be described as a ‘bulge’ in the landscape. It is thought that the site lies on reclaimed land that was previously used as landfill. It is not known what method was used to cap the landfill once it had reached capacity, although it is obvious that a depth of soil exists across the whole of the open space and woodland areas.

At the time of the survey being conducted, there was visible evidence of knotweed infestation within the boundaries of the subject property. One stand of Japanese knotweed (JK1) was identified.

Growth at stand JK1 was stunted although it appeared to be healthy, with normal colouration and full-size leaves. The stems were relatively thin and the tallest stem was 60 cm high. The stand presented as two clusters of stems separated by roughly 8 metres. The stand was around 10 metres in length in total but could only be said to be 1 metre wide.

Stand JK1 was positioned approximately 7 metres from the nearest path, 50 metres from the water’s edge and 115 metres from the nearest point of the car park that serves the park. Stand JK1 was not located near to any built structures.
Aerial/satellite imagery available on Google Earth does not reveal any information that would identify the source and spread of the knotweed stand on site. 

Aside from the stands of Japanese knotweed already mentioned, no other instances of knotweed infestation were seen when surveying the grounds of the subject property.

Further survey information and details can be found within the appendices to this document.

The boundaries are formed by fencing, hedges and walls, with a stream that runs to the River Winniford creating the north boundary.  The land within the boundaries generally is sloping, with steeper slopes forming the banks of the stream. 
The survey was focused on Japanese knotweed and was by walkthrough at ground level.
During the survey a number of small stands of knotweed were identified as impacting upon the subject property, some of which previously had been treated by our client and/or their ground maintenance contractor. All of the stands, bar one, were noted as active. None of the stands were identified as high risk, meaning that the threat to the property, including structures and the amenity value of the garden is low. Of the ten stands identified, only two were within 10 metres of the dwelling. Four of the identified stands were classed as being cross-boundary. One of these (stand JK2) appeared to be dormant, likely as a result of previous treatments. The only other cross-boundary stand with any proximity to a building was stand JK5, this being 10 metres from the dwelling of an adjacent property (i.e. posing no threat to the structure).
Growth at the various stands was still developing, meaning that treatment at the time of survey was not appropriate, with mid-summer being the earliest recommended time to start the control programme.
No other stands of Japanese knotweed were identified during the survey. Our client and any contractors should be aware of the potential for knotweed growth to arise in other locations within the property.
Satellite/aerial imagery of the location does not reveal any further salient information regarding the origins or any movement of knotweed at or near the subject property.

Although the majority of the stands are small and low-risk in terms of their location, without a proper control programme in place the chances of knotweed growth spreading out from its current locations is increased.
Our client has treated manty of the knotweed stands previously; this could make effective treatment more difficult and so decisions over how and when to treat each stand must be taken carefully.
The five years of treatment proposed allows time for treatments to be spread out, allowing knotweed growth to develop as fully as possible each season before a treatment is carried out, thus maximizing the chance of good uptake of chemical by the plant.
Clearance of vegetation around knotweed stands may be undertaken by grounds maintenance personnel after specific instructions have been relayed from PBA Solutions to the contractor. This will be more cost-effective for our client.","Knotweed infestation is cross-boundary,Knotweed is growing near water,Knotweed has previously been treated by others,Soil has been disturbed near/within knotweed-impacted areas",,Herbicide treatment,,General vegetation cut back or herbicide treatment,,For treating knotweed on the bank of the stream a small spray unit is advised.,"Two adjacent properties that are impacted by knotweed growth will be included for under the terms of this KMP, namely 'The Guard House' and 'The Guard House Studio' (property name to be confirmed).

One stand of knotweed (JK1) was identified during the survey. Stand JK1 was located at the far end of the rear garden of the subject property and the adjacent property, 173 Ray Street. A third property (5 Hill Road, adjacent rear) was identified as potentially containing a small portion of growth at JK1, although this depends on boundary placement which was not clear at the time of the survey. It should be noted that there is a ground-level drop of at least one metre from the rear garden of 173 Ray Street to the land belonging to 5 Hill Road.
Stand JK1 was seen to be approximately 9 metres long and 3.5 metres wide in total. Growth seen in number 173 was lush and healthy, with densely packed stems full of well-developed leaf. Growth at number 171 was less healthy looking, with less dense leaf coverage, yellowing and drying leaves and a developing brittleness to the stems. It was reported to the surveyor that the knotweed growth had been treated with herbicide by the owner of the property prior to the survey.
Knotweed stand was approximately 19 metres from the dwelling of the subject property, approximately 20 metres from the dwelling of 173 Ray Street and approximately 1.5 metres (horizontally) to the dwelling of 5 Hill Road. The drop in ground level between the knotweed and the dwelling of 5 Hill Road was noted as being good protection against ingress.
Satellite imagery* of the vicinity dating back to circa 1985 does not reveal any pertinent information relating to the origin, location or spread of stand JK1 due to the poor quality of the imagery.

Active knotweed growth was seen within the gardens of 47, 49 and 51 Church Lane. It was noted that the growth in the rear garden of number 49 Church Lane had been cut prior to the inspection taking place. The four stands ranged in distance between 12 and 17 metres from the dwellings and totalled approximately 25 square metres of visibly impacted garden space. Stand  JK1, roughly covering an area of some 14 square metres, was the largest of the four stands.
Because of the relative locations of stands JK1, JK3 and JK4, it is safe to surmise that connecting rhizome exists in the soil between the areas of visible growth. If true, this would mean that these three stands are, in reality, one single cross-boundary stand. It may be the case that stand JK2 is also connected, although there is a little more separation between JK2 and the other stands.
Satellite imagery of the site (Google Earth, 1986 to the present) and adjacent properties does not reveal any useful information. The images are generally of too low a quality to discern the level of detail needed to claim proof of changes in the size, shape and location of the knotweed stands seen during the survey.",,,,,,,,,,,Management Plan,,Japanese Knotweed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Google Earth imagery circa 2000, 2004. 2009 , 2013 and 2018. This series of images shows clearly the location, shape and size of a single stand of Japanese knotweed (JK1) that, at the time, was impacting land owned by Surrey County Council and land within the boundaries of the subject property. The first three of these images shows an established and apparently healthy stand of knotweed, with connected growth on both sides of the party boundary. Measurement s show that an area of approximately 135 square metres was visibly impacted by knotweed growth at that time, with a roughly equal split of the total area across the two plots (subject property 68 sq.m. vs Surrey County Council land 65 sq.m.).
Google Earth imagery circa 2013 appears to show evidence that treatment of the knotweed stand had taken place and that standing canes had been cut back. Consequently, imagery circa 2018 presents a picture of patchy regrowth becoming established once more and finally, imagery circa 2020/2021 shows the rear garden of the subject property in a more ordered state after excavation and removal of knotweed had been carried out, along with reinstatement.

However, given the history of a large stand Japanese knotweed being established at the subject property and on land adjacent, and given that the knotweed immediately outside the boundaries of the subject property was not excavated but treated by herbicide, it is safe to assume that regrowth of knotweed from viable rhizome deep in the soil remains a possibility.
During the survey the position and profile of the installed root barrier was discussed. Originally after the installation the root barrier profile included an 'upstand', a section of barrier visible above ground level. The purpose of an upstand is to prevent any crossing of the root barrier line by growth of knotweed rhizome that may lie outside the area protected by the barrier. At the request of the property owner, the upstand was re-profiled, with the top 300 mm or so of barrier being laid horizontally in the soil after a thin line of surrounding soil had been dug away. This process removed the traditional upstand feature and increased the risk of knotweed rhizome growth from soil outside the barrier back into the subject property.",,,,,,,,,,,Management Plan,,Japanese Knotweed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As the knotweed stand is well-established, the volume of rhizome beneath the hardstanding may be extensive. For this reason the control programme must take in a significant span of time; a five year treatment programme is recommended, followed by two further years of monitoring visits.
Our client may wish to discuss an alternative method of control, such as excavation and removal off-site of knotweed-impacted soil. This would require a root barrier installation and would be considerably more expensive than a herbicide treatment programme.
The first years of the control programme will require two visits per year (during the summer months) and this can be reduced to one visit per year in the latter stages. This will allow the knotweed time to develop fully before a treatment is applied (the knotweed will grow more slowly after the first treatments).
All knotweed growth must be allowed to develop fully (it must not be cut down, pulled out or otherwise interfered with).
As the knotweed infestation is cross-boundary, treatments of live growth at the adjacent affected properties will be required. This requires the property owners' permission. Our client will need to arrange access and provide written permission.
Please note that two herbicide application treatment shave already taken place; these were undertaken by PBA Solutions during the summer of 2021 and 2022 under the instruction of Waltham Forest Borough Council.","Knotweed infestation is cross-boundary,Knotweed rhizome is near/under hard surfacing",,Herbicide treatment,,"""Breakout of hard surfaces (paving, concrete etc)""",,,"163 Billet Road

The recent survey was carried out by walk-through at ground level. One stand of Japanese knotweed (JK1) was identified as impacting upon the subject property. Data gathered in 2021 showed that JK1 was an established stand, with vigorous growth appearing in the rear garden of the subject property and two adjacent properties, making this a cross-boundary or shared infestation. One other adjacent property was close enough to the site boundary to be classed as being impacted by knotweed, although no growth was observed in that property.
Most of the growth observed in the rear garden of the subject property was located around the edge of an area of hardstanding.  JK1 was seen to be around 8 metres long and five metres wide at its furthest extents, with an area of approximately 16 square metres of visible stem growth across the impacted rear gardens. At the nearest point JK1 was 5 metres from the dwelling at the subject property.
During the more recent survey, the effects of two treatment visits was clearly seen, with a very substantial reduction in the volume of visible growth.
Looking at imagery from Google Earth did not reveal any information pertinent to the origins of JK1 at the subject property, nor of its movement or spread over time.
No other instances of knotweed growth were seen during the survey.",,,,,,,,,,,Management Plan,,Japanese Knotweed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

At the time of the survey 51 high street was inspected but no evidence of visible knotweed was seen.  The outside space of  49a and 51 are in poor condition, the back gardens are very overgrown which limited our ability to determine if there was further knotweed growing within these properties. 

The knotweed that was identified is within a paved area of 49a, growing near a boundary fence and is close to the dwelling (49). Inspection covers for utilities are also nearby.  

The presence of paving will limit our ability to control this invasive plant and while we have initially proposed a 4-year treatment program it must be accepted that treatments and monitoring may be required for a longer term.  Where a shorter treatment plan is required consideration should be given to lifting paving. In addition, it is important that knotweed is treated within 47 and 49a at the same time.

The stand appears to be established but returning to full health (as opposed to being fully healthy at the time of the survey).
The site is to be developed, with front and rear extensions being added to both the subject property dwelling and the adjacent plot dwelling. The location of stand JK1 in relation to the proposed extensions is such that a programme of herbicide treatment will not suffice and, if used alone would cause problems for the developer, with the timescale being too far into the future and the possibility of viable rhizome remaining in the ground even after control (prevention of visible stem growth) has been established.
Excavation of knotweed-impacted soil is therefore a better fit for the site requirements, offering immediate remediation. However, there is no room within the site to stockpile waste soil and treat knotweed regrowth, or to utilise cell-burial of excavated soil. Waste therefore should be removed off-site to a landfill licenced to accept controlled waste.
Due to the relative positions of the buildings and the knotweed, deep excavation will not be possible using standard equipment and, if done without using any form of support structure, would endanger the stability and integrity of the buildings. Using specialist equipment (e.g. trench box) would be hard to achieve in the tight working space available. Therefore the excavation must be limited to an agreed depth to preserve the structural integrity of the buildings: this will, almost inevitably mean that a small amount of knotweed rhizome has to be left in the soil where it lies below the final level of the excavation.
To counteract this and to ensure adequate protection for the buildings and the gardens of the properties, a root barrier should be installed at the base of the excavation. This will prevent the re-ingress of knotweed growth into the site. The root barrier must be covered with a protective blinding layer (fleece or sand) before backfilling takes place. A small upstand of barrier (e.g. 50 mm above finished ground level) must be preserved where it sits vertically against a building or boundary line.
The knotweed removal and barrier install must be followed up by a programme of scheduled visits (performed under contract) during which the open space of the site will be inspected for signs of knotweed regrowth. If any regrowth is identified (which is very unlikely), this will be treated by spray application of herbicide (or a similar method) as appropriate. Two visits per year should take place for three consecutive years. The visits must be during the knotweed growth season (approx. June to October).","Knotweed infestation is cross-boundary,Knotweed is growing close to house (within 3 metres)",,Excavation and removal off-site,,Follow-up inspections with herbicide treatment,,,26 Dupre Crescent (a separate KMP has been issued for this property),2022,1,October,3,4,31 October 2022,31 October 2025,Express,1 November 2025,31 October 2035,,,,,,,,,,,,,Herbicide spray foliar application,,"Excavation and removal of waste,Root barrier installation",,,,,,"Herbicide treatment was completed 07/10/2022

Presenting as an established linear stand in the rear garden of the subject property, JK1 appeared relatively healthy at the time of the survey, potentially benefitting after a period of time where it had not been cut back (the subject property had been left vacant prior to the survey).
Closer inspection revealed a 'return' of stem growth around the front corner and into the front garden of the adjacent property, meaning the stand is approximately 'L' shaped. 
JK1 was noted as growing directly against the east and north side outer walls of the adjacent property dwelling.

Many of the stems had developed fully, reaching heights of approximately 2.5 metres in places.
Most leaves were green and fully developed.
A few leaves, close to ground level, had developed some rust fungus, although this did not appear to have reduced the vigour of the plant.
In terms of visible (above-ground) growth, stand JK1 occupied around 8 square metres of land in the subject property and a further 3 in the adjacent property.

No other instances of Japanese knotweed were seen during the survey within the boundaries of the subject property and the adjacent properties.

The stand appears to be established but returning to full health (as opposed to being fully healthy at the time of the survey).
The site is to be developed, with front and rear extensions being added to both the subject property dwelling and the adjacent plot dwelling. The location of stand JK1 in relation to the proposed extensions is such that a programme of herbicide treatment will not suffice and, if used alone would cause problems for the developer, with the timescale being too far into the future and the possibility of viable rhizome remaining in the ground even after control (prevention of visible stem growth) has been established.
Excavation of knotweed-impacted soil is therefore a better fit for the site requirements, offering immediate remediation. However, there is no room within the site to stockpile waste soil and treat knotweed regrowth, or to utilise cell-burial of excavated soil. Waste therefore should be removed off-site to a landfill licenced to accept controlled waste.
Due to the relative positions of the buildings and the knotweed, deep excavation will not be possible using standard equipment and, if done without using any form of support structure, would endanger the stability and integrity of the buildings. Using specialist equipment (e.g. trench box) would be hard to achieve in the tight working space available. Therefore the excavation must be limited to an agreed depth to preserve the structural integrity of the buildings: this will, almost inevitably mean that a small amount of knotweed rhizome has to be left in the soil where it lies below the final level of the excavation.
To counteract this and to ensure adequate protection for the buildings and the gardens of the properties, a root barrier should be installed at the base of the excavation. This will prevent the re-ingress of knotweed growth into the site. The root barrier must be covered with a protective blinding layer (fleece or sand) before backfilling takes place. A small upstand of barrier (e.g. 50 mm above finished ground level) must be preserved where it sits vertically against a building or boundary line.
The knotweed removal and barrier install must be followed up by a programme of scheduled visits (performed under contract) during which the open space of the site will be inspected for signs of knotweed regrowth. If any regrowth is identified (which is very unlikely), this will be treated by spray application of herbicide (or a similar method) as appropriate. Two visits per year should take place for three consecutive years. The visits must be during the knotweed growth season (approx. June to October).","Knotweed infestation is cross-boundary,Knotweed is growing close to house (within 3 metres)",,Excavation and removal off-site,,Follow-up inspections with herbicide treatment,,,28 Dupre Crescent (a separate KMP has been issued for this property),2022,1,October,3,4,31 October 2022,31 October 2025,Express,1 November 2025,31 October 2035,,,,,,,,,,,,,Herbicide spray foliar application,,"Excavation and removal of waste,Root barrier installation",,,,,,,,,,,,,Monitoring,,,,Monitoring,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Monitoring,,Monitoring,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Monitoring,,Monitoring,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2022-06-29,"""Phil Cox.

One established stand of Japanese knotweed (stand JK1) was identified during the survey as impacting upon the subject property and one adjacent property, 28 Dupre Crescent.

Presenting as an established linear stand in the front garden of the subject property, JK1 appeared relatively healthy at the time of the survey, potentially benefitting after a period of time where it had not been cut back (the subject property had been left vacant prior to the survey).
Closer inspection revealed a 'return' of stem growth around the front corner and into the rear garden of the adjacent property, meaning the stand is approximately 'L' shaped. 
JK1 was noted as growing directly against the east and north side outer walls of the subject property dwelling.

Many of the stems had developed fully, reaching heights of approximately 2.5 metres in places.
Most leaves were green and fully developed.
A few leaves, close to ground level, had developed some rust fungus, although this did not appear to have reduced the vigour of the plant.
In terms of visible (above-ground) growth, stand JK1 occupied around 3 square metres of land in the subject property and a further 8 in the adjacent property, where it was growing against the side wall of the dwelling.

No other instances of Japanese knotweed were seen during the survey within the boundaries of the subject property and the adjacent properties.
Satellite imagery (Google Earth) from 1985 to the present day does not reveal any information regarding the origins of stand JK1 at the subject property, nor any changes in size, shape or location over time.",,,,,,,,,,,Management Plan,,Japanese Knotweed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The growth was less than 10 cm high and presented as an emergent shoot. It’s doubtful that this plant would ever cause any problems since no growths have been reported for several years. This shoot of Japanese knotweed was treated when undertaking the survey.

When at the very back of the garden looking into neighbouring gardens there is a fenced-off area with a knotweed treatment sign present suggesting that this knotweed is being controlled by another contractor. We believe this area of knotweed to be stand location four (see map).  This stand of knotweed is more than 5 m from the subject properties boundary.",,,,,,,,,,,Management Plan,,Japanese Knotweed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is intended that these off-site areas of knotweed are to be managed through a separate herbicide treatment program.

At the time of the survey, the knotweed exhibited healthy growth, being in full leaf. The knotweed has also established itself near a paved area but is a long way, circa 20 metres from the dwelling. 

Since the knotweed has taken over the entire width of the garden, it is proposed that the impacted land be excavated with a specialist root barrier installed vertically and horizontally so that the affected part of the garden can then be used. The root barrier will be installed to have a good depth of soil cover above. Upon completion, the area will be inspected to monitor for any knotweed regrowth.

One other stand (JK1) was identified off site on an adjacent property (thought to be 27 Surrey Road) and, although not impacting upon the subject property in the short term, would ideally come under an herbicide control programme.
Stand JK1 presented as healthy, with good height stems and plenty of green leaf. However, stem growth was patchy, with the most probable cause of this being the tree canopy above reducing light levels on the ground. JK1 was growing in sloping land near to the rear of the back garden of the adjacent property. At its nearest point JK1 was roughly two metres from the subject property boundary. 
JK2 presented as a single stem cluster which appeared to be struggling, although stems had reached a decent height. It is possible that a lack of water was causing the plant to struggle. Visibly a small stand, the plant was surrounded by dense bramble cover (as well as other annual and perennial weeds). Growing close to the boundary on the east side of the site, JK2 was also within a few metres of an area of paving. It is worth noting that the ground level of the adjacent property (25 Surrey Road) is approximately one metre higher than the ground level at the location of stand JK1; this provides a level of protection against knotweed from JK1 appearing at ground level in the adjacent property.
There was no active knotweed growth recorded at the previously recorded location in the front garden of the communal land of 27A Surrey Road.",,,,,,,,,,,Management Plan,,Japanese Knotweed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Satellite imagery of the subject property from 1986 to the present day does not reveal any pertinent information relating to the origin, location or spread of stand JK1, due in part to the presence of a mature tree in the vicinity until it was felled circa 2016-2017.

The knotweed stand comprises tall (2m) dead canes and smaller active growths. It appears that the knotweed has been treated recently, resulting in the presence of dead canes and smaller live shoots. However, two more prominent knotweed canes were not killed off by the recent herbicide treatment. 

The knotweed stand is 5 metres from the dwelling and 1.5 metres from the property boundary. The knotweed is growing in an elevated position to that of the neighbouring property. While the sight of the neighbour's land was somewhat obstructed, it's doubtful that knotweed is present due to the change in levels. Nevertheless, an inspection of the neighbouring property would be beneficial early on in the treatment program.

A telegraph pole is present within the stand of knotweed. This pole to the untrained eye appears in good condition. Methodology would need to be agreed upon by PBA before any work to remove or replace the telegraph pole or any work which may disturb the knotweed stand. PBA would also wish to be in attendance during such work. The reason for requiring methodology and being present during such work is to preserve any guarantee and ensure the treatment plan is not compromised.

Treatment and monitoring of the Japanese knotweed are required if it is to be brought fully under control. In addition to herbicide treatment, other vegetation in the area must be cut back to open the thicket up. For a treatment program to work effectively, good growing conditions are needed. This requirement may seem counterintuitive, but we need some knotweed growth so that herbicides can be drawn into the rhizome of the target plant through translocation. For this to work, the target plant must photosynthesise and be healthy.",,,,,,,,,,,Management Plan,,Japanese Knotweed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One of these, stand JK1 was identified off site on an adjacent property (thought to be 27 Surrey Road) and, although unlikely to impact directly upon the subject property in the short term, would ideally come under an herbicide control programme to prevent future spread.
Stand JK1 presented as healthy, with good height stems and plenty of green leaf. However, stem growth was patchy, with the most probable cause of this being the tree canopy above reducing light levels on the ground. JK1 was growing in sloping land near to the rear of the back garden of the adjacent property. At its nearest point JK1 was roughly two metres from the subject property boundary but 20 metres from the nearest point of the dwelling.
Knotweed stand JK2 was located within the site of 27A Surrey Road but with land owned separately to the communal land as part of 'Patio Flat, 27A Surrey Road. Stand JK2 presented as a single stem cluster which appeared to be struggling, although stems had reached a decent height. It is possible that a lack of water was causing the plant to struggle. Visibly a small stand, the plant was surrounded by dense bramble cover (as well as other annual and perennial weeds). Growing close to the boundary on the east side of the site, JK2 was also within a few metres of an area of paving. It is worth noting that the ground level of the adjacent property (25 Surrey Road) is approximately one metre higher than the ground level at the location of stand JK1; this provides a level of protection against knotweed from JK1 appearing at ground level in the adjacent property.
There was no active knotweed growth recorded at the previously recorded location in the front garden of the communal land of 27A Surrey Road.",,,,,,,,,,,Management Plan,,Japanese Knotweed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One of these, stand JK1 was identified off site on an adjacent property (thought to be 27 Surrey Road) and, although unlikely to impact directly upon the subject property in the short term, would ideally come under an herbicide control programme to prevent future spread.
Stand JK1 presented as healthy, with good height stems and plenty of green leaf. However, stem growth was patchy, with the most probable cause of this being the tree canopy above reducing light levels on the ground. JK1 was growing in sloping land near to the rear of the back garden of the adjacent property. At its nearest point JK1 was roughly two metres from the subject property boundary but 20 metres from the nearest point of the dwelling.
Knotweed stand JK2 was located within the site of 27A Surrey Road but with land owned separately to the communal land as part of 'Patio Flat, 27A Surrey Road. Stand JK2 presented as a single stem cluster which appeared to be struggling, although stems had reached a decent height. It is possible that a lack of water was causing the plant to struggle. Visibly a small stand, the plant was surrounded by dense bramble cover (as well as other annual and perennial weeds). Growing close to the boundary on the east side of the site, JK2 was also within a few metres of an area of paving. It is worth noting that the ground level of the adjacent property (25 Surrey Road) is approximately one metre higher than the ground level at the location of stand JK1; this provides a level of protection against knotweed from JK1 appearing at ground level in the adjacent property.
There was no active knotweed growth recorded at the previously recorded location in the front garden of the communal land of 27A Surrey Road.",,,,,,,,,,,Management Plan,,Japanese Knotweed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Notes from the 1st Edition of the RICS guidance paper on this category state:

Note 8: Record presence and location [of the knotweed stand] in notes but no action required for lending purposes:
• No specific action is required when reporting for lending purposes if the visible infestation is of- site and more than 3m from the boundary, but the surveyor or valuer should make an appropriate record in the site notes.
• Recording the apparent number and sizes of individual stands of Japanese knotweed (as described in section 3.8) may assist with this process.
• Exceptionally, if there are concerns about infestation further than 3m from the boundary possibly affecting future value and saleability, assess as Management Category D: Report, and follow note 7 (see section 4.4).
• Reporting or advice to clients for purposes other than lending will depend on the specific instructions relating to the inspection and, if appropriate, the survey level (see section 5.4).",,,,,,,,,,,Management Plan,,Japanese Knotweed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite this, regrowth has occurred on an annual basis, albeit in stunted or very stunted form.
Because of this, it is recommended that the knotweed rhizome network is broken up by cultivation of the host soil. This will encourage regrowth from the disturbed rhizome and allow herbicide to be translocated to previously untouched sections of rhizome, bringing about faster and more widespread weakening of the plant as a whole.
Any rhizome fragments that are fully exposed by the cultivation should be removed from the soil and allowed to dry out completely under safe conditions. A drying bag constructed of specialist root barrier can be provided for this purpose (although our client can provide a suitable alternative).
To complement this, cover vegetation in and around the stands should be cut back to ground level and maintained as far as possible in this state until the next herbicide treatment is applied.
The cycle of clearance, cultivation and treatment should be repeated over three consecutive years, with a monitoring visit prior to the treatment visit included annually also.

Essentially knotweed was present in 49 Brookwell Park Gardens which backs onto number eight (stand two). Dead knotweed was also present in the garden of the current surgery, at number 10 (stand one).

The findings were:
Stand 1: Only Dead knotweed found
Stand 2: A single stem 0.3m high was found  (Photograph at the end of this report)

For the development work and as a preventative measure waste for the external walls was removed as knotweed contaminated with a specialist root barrier installed by PBA. 
PBA provided a  separate report for this work. 

In summary, the following methodology/procedure was followed
 
1) Garden wall removed 
2) It was assumed that soil waste was potentially contaminated behind the wall
3) The builder was briefed to maintain hygiene, not to spread soil in boots and segregate impacted waste from that which is not impacted by knotweed. 
4) All soil waste was removed in rubble sacks (PBA inspected at this time 26/11/15 )
5) Waste is to be removed off-site to a registered landfill site able to take waste impacted by knotweed (Client organised) 
6) A root barrier was installed vertically (See Photo at the end of this report) to the site perimeter which is also the retaining wall of the extension. The purpose of the root barrier is to block any potential knotweed from growing back into the site or interfering with the new wall.

One or two treatments should be applied per year for a period of five years until control has been gained, preventing further visible stem growth. Three years of monitoring should follow the treatment schedule.
The knotweed stand is likely to include a large volume of established rhizome beneath the path and built structures in the rear garden of 383 Lordship Lane, and the outbuilding in the rear garden of 385 Lordship Lane. The expense of removing the floors of the outbuildings in order to access the knotweed rhizome cannot be justified. However, with the path (383) being accessible, removal of the slabs making up the path in the impacted area is recommended, with a fine gravel covering to replace the slabs. This will allow the knotweed to produce more stem growth more freely in the seasons following the removal, in turn allowing for more effective treatments to take place. 
Surface rhizome in the area should be dug out (by hand) after a year or two of herbicide treatment, with waste removal and disposal under licence. 
Items obscuring or covering the knotweed growth areas must be removed, inspected/cleaned in situ and stored elsewhere on site. 
Standing knotweed canes should be cut back and removed during the first winter of the treatment programme.

The identified knotweed stand (JK1) visibly is spread over an area of 3 metres by 2 metres, with clusters of growth along the boundary line making up the bulk of the visible growth and one solitary stem within the lawn in the subject property garden. The knotweed is growing adjacent to and beneath outbuildings and a path at the rear of the gardens. Within the subject property, the majority of the knotweed stems were growing in a gap approximately 10 centimetres wide between the fence and an area of hardstanding.

It is likely that the rhizome mass in the soil is well-established, given that the stand is managing to put out full height stems from such constrained conditions. The presence of knotweed in the lawn may be larger than what was seen during the survey, as mowing or cutting back can conceal returning growth. Logs and other items that were stored near the outbuildings were also partly concealing knotweed stems.

Satellite/aerial photographs (Google Earth, Google Maps, Bing Maps) dating back to 1999 do not reveal any conclusive information pertinent to this survey, other than the rear garden of the subject property being densely populated with plants including small trees circa 2000-2010.

Works have been carried out at the property in the meantime. No knotweed was seen growing in the first year of ownership. Works in the garden have since taken place with reduction in some soil levels (soil removed from site) and three no JK plants appeared in around July / August this growing season. At the survey date it is not possible to tell if this has come from an established root system disturbance, or possibly rhizome fragments imported to site via JK contaminated equipment / boots.

Client has self administered herbicide treatment and the above ground growth has died back with no further shoots appearing in the meantime. 

Would suggest an exploratory hand dig to determine if the evident plants have grown from fragments or if there is an established root system in the ground. Come equipped to complete the job in a day, if from fragments these can be sealed within CuTex sack and left to dry onsite.

Covering approximately 1300 square metres, the site is roughly triangular in shape. The site is bounded by commercial units to the south, Brent Park Road along the west-to-north diagonal and a rail embankment on the north-to-east diagonal. Generally, the site is located within a row of commercial units on the Edgeware Road (A5), with the Brent reservoir lying to the west and a rail line, the M1 and the Brent Cross area to the north and east.

The history of the site is not known in any detail to PBA Solutions, although historical satellite imagery* from the last 20 years appears to show the site being used for commercial vehicle and static caravan storage.

The site was inspected for evidence of present, recent and past Japanese knotweed activity. Land adjacent to the site was not inspected directly during the survey, but could be seen from within the site to an acceptable level.

The survey was focused on looking for evidence of: 
Active knotweed stem and leaf growth (both full size and stunted),
Knotweed crowns and rhizome fragments (active and dormant),
Senescent growth,
Growth from past seasons (standing canes, cane fragments, leaves),
Hidden or obscured growth (bagged, covered or piled knotweed material, shallow holes containing rhizome fragments).

During the survey:
No visible growth of present or very recent Japanese knotweed was seen.
No evidence of past infestation by Japanese knotweed was seen (e.g. no cane fragments, no leaf litter, no dormant crowns).
No evidence was seen of attempts to hide or obscure the presence of
Japanese knotweed within the site (e.g. bagged/covered knotweed waste, shallow holes containing rhizome/crown fragments).
No evidence was seen of knotweed being present on land adjacent to the site.

It was noted that dense vegetation covered portions (approximately 15%) of the site and there was little sign of it having been cut back within the past few years. Given that knotweed stems will often grow to exceed the surrounding vegetation height, rather than making the survey findings less clear, this makes it more likely that any knotweed growth present at the time of the survey would have been visible.

The survey findings as set out above are valid for a period of one year from the date of the survey.",,,,,,,,,,,Management Plan,,Japanese Knotweed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although rainy to start with, the weather improved during the survey and visibility throughout was good.
The whole of the site was inspected, with areas of dense vegetation or limited access being viewed from multiple locations. 
The site boundary was identified using a combination of supplied plans and digital mapping.
Land adjacent to the site was not inspected directly during the survey, but could be seen to an acceptable level from within the site.

The survey was focused on looking for evidence of:
Active knotweed stem and leaf growth (both full size and stunted),
Knotweed crowns and rhizome fragments (active and dormant), 
Senescent growth,
Growth from past seasons (standing canes, cane fragments, leaves/leaf litter),
Hidden or obscured growth (bagged, covered or piled knotweed material, shallow holes containing rhizome fragments). 

During the survey, within the site boundaries:
No active Japanese knotweed growth was seen.
No evidence of very recent Japanese knotweed growth was seen.
No evidence of dormant Japanese knotweed was seen.
No evidence of past infestation by Japanese knotweed was seen.
No evidence was seen of attempts to hide or obscure the presence of Japanese knotweed within the site.

During the survey, outside the site boundaries:
Two stands of Japanese knotweed were seen; both of these stands were already known to PBA Solutions and to our client.
Both stands are under treatment by PBA Solutions.
No growth was seen at stand JK1 (it has appeared dormant this year).
At stand JK2, one very stunted stem of knotweed was seen (and treated).
Stand JK2, the nearest stand to the site boundary, being positioned 20 metres from the boundary is not considered to pose any kind of threat to the site.

The site was inspected for evidence of present, recent and past Japanese knotweed activity. Land adjacent to the site was not inspected directly during the survey but could be seen from within the subject land to an acceptable level.

The survey was focused on looking for evidence of the following: 
- Active knotweed stem and leaf growth (both full-size and stunted)
- Knotweed crowns and rhizome fragments (active and dormant)
- Senescent growth
- Growth from past seasons (standing canes, cane fragments, leaves)
- Hidden or obscured growth (bagged, covered, or piled knotweed material, shallow holes containing rhizome fragments).

During the survey the surveyor noted:
- No visible growth of present or very recent Japanese knotweed was seen.
- No evidence of past infestation by Japanese knotweed was seen (e.g. no cane fragments, no leaf litter, no dormant crowns).
- No evidence was seen of attempts to hide or obscure the presence of Japanese knotweed within the site (e.g. bagged/covered knotweed waste, shallow holes containing rhizome/crown fragments).

Evidence of Japanese knotweed was seen at 5 Ramsey Close, next door but one. Knotweed was also seen on the land between 257 and Bothwick Road, being more than 10m away. Knotweed is also likely to be at 259.

The Japanese knotweed on the land between 257 and Bothwick Road is the subject of an ongoing Knotweed Treatment Plan with another Invasive Weed Company. A survey from circa 2019 depicts Japanese knotweed being visible in 4 properties, and likely to be present in 4 additional properties. 

The subject land 265-269 was designated in 2019 as being expected to harbour Japanese knotweed rhizome. The neighbouring property, 263, was depicted as having visible knotweed. During our survey (2022), neither of these 2 properties had any evidence of Japanese knotweed growth. 

During the inspection, vegetation was cut-back to check for emergent Japanese knotweed growth but nothing was found. The land does not appear to be maintained and is relatively inaccessible which means that had knotweed rhizome been present, it would have developed and been visible at some point between 2019 and 2022. From our inspection, this appears not to be the case and on this basis, it is unlikely that knotweed rhizome is present at 265-269.

Whether this is the pint of origin of the infestation present in the rear garden of 55 Leslie Road is not clear. However, it does appear that the bulk of the infestation arose, or at least was allowed to establish, at 55 Leslie Road.
The presence of paving and a number of outbuildings in close proximity to the knotweed stand has given the rhizomes of the plant a number of places to 'hide', while for the same reason this will also make achieving full control of the knotweed very difficult.
If at all possible, all owners of the properties affected by this large stand should be encouraged to work together to combat the problem.
It is unlikely that full control of this stand will ever be achieved if treatments are conducted in an uncoordinated fashion.
PBA Solutions understands that a specialist contractor, Japanese Knotweed Ltd, has been instructed for a knotweed control programme at 53 Leslie Road. This contractor must be made aware of other control programmes, so that an effective approach to the issue can be planned and delivered.
Herbicide treatments of available growth at the subject property should start as soon as possible, with two visits per year being made during the growth season to monitor and treat the knotweed, as necessary and appropriate, for a minimum of five years.
Without removal of outbuildings, fencing and areas of paving/hardstanding it is likely that, after a few years of treatments, knotweed will continue to reappear sporadically (e.g. every two or three years). For this reason it is suggested that contingency should be made to provide monitoring visits to the subject property beyond the five years recommended above.

Root barrier installation (CuTex) to protect subject property boundary and prevent future re-ingress of knotweed from Russell Street properties.",,,,"The preferred and recommended method for dealing with Japanese knotweed infestation at the subject site is to excavate and remove off-site all knotweed-impacted waste material, reducing the risk, hindrances and constraints to development that are posed by the presence of Japanese knotweed. 
Herbicide treatment, either alone or alongside crown severing and rhizome fragmentation, will not provide control in a timely manner, or the promise of full remediation. As a small site, an on-site cell burial is not a practical option. Relocating the waste arising from excavation is not viable as the site is too small for the ongoing storage of potentially knotweed-impacted waste soil (this reason also makes waste sifting non-viable). 
Due to the cross-boundary nature of the knotweed infestation, a suitable root barrier must be installed along the boundary at the relevant locations, preventing future re-ingress of the plant from the adjacent property gardens. 
Any residual risk will be negated by conducting a follow-up programme of scheduled visits to the site for the purpose of monitoring for knotweed regrowth, with treatment as necessary and appropriate.","Knotweed infestation is cross-boundary,Knotweed rhizome is near/under hard surfacing,Knotweed has previously been treated by others,Soil has been disturbed near/within knotweed-impacted areas",,Excavation and removal off-site,,"Follow-up inspections with herbicide treatment,Installation of root barrier",,,Not applicable,2022,1,Summer,2,3,31 October 2022,31 October 2024,Express,1 November 2024,31 October 2034,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-10-13,"""Phil Cox.

Close to the road entrance, the knotweed appears to be sitting on the party boundary with little ingress into site although the rear gardens adjacent may be more severely impacted.
The footprint and one outer wall of an old print works are located further into site, approximately 17 metres from the road entrance.
Knotweed is located between the boundary wall and the old print works wall. Historical imagery of the site reveals a well-established infestation in this location, with vegetation clearly visible growing above the top of the two walls.
A waste stockpile that may contain knotweed rhizome fragments or that may be hosting connected rhizome is located near to the front edge of the remaining print works wall.
It is thought that the knotweed stand (JK1) is a minimum of 20 metres long and may be longer, given that the land at each end of the stand cannot be inspected thoroughly by normal means. The site floor consists of concrete hardstanding and tarmac surfacing.

During the survey, one stand (JK1) of Japanese knotweed was noted as being present within the boundaries of the subject property.

Land directly adjacent in the adjacent property was viewed by looking over the boundary fence. No evidence of previous knotweed growth was seen on that land. However, some vegetation clearance had taken place previously, evidenced by fragments of dried plant stems scattered across the area. The species of the plants concerned could not be determined from the fragments.
There was no visible evidence of Japanese knotweed growth in other areas of the subject property.
